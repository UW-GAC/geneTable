# genetable

The goal of genetable is to provide some utility functions for making a database table of gene boundary definitions. For now, it is focused on GeneCode gene definitions, as defined in the GENCODE .gtf files, such as availble at https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/

## Installation

You can install genetable from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UW-GAC/genetable")
```

## Example

Once we make it, we'll add a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem!
